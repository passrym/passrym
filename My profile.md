- 👋 Hello, I’m @passrym
- 👀 I am interested in dev but all dev languages (Java/html&css/ruby/js/ and others).
- 🌱 I’m learning or rather review the Html, CSS and JS.
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate for a group, company or any person who is looking for a person.
- 📫 The best way to reach me is by my email: find yourself to send me an email (it’s not really complicated)
- 😄 Pronouns: I don’t know what to put in
- ⚡ Fun fact: I don’t touch anything with the Kinder brand
